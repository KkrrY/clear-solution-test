Despite the requirement stating that a data persistence layer wasn't necessary,
its inclusion was deemed beneficial for enhanced functionality and maintainability.
The implementation utilizes a data persistence layer with the H2 in-memory database.
H2, requiring no connection parameters, seamlessly launches out-of-the-box.
H2's lightweight nature and integration with Spring Boot made it a suitable choice. 
Furthermore, H2 facilitated rapid development and vtesting, ensuring robust data management capabilities.
